## Introduction to Cloud Computing



Cloud computing is a modern approach to delivering IT resources over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure, organizations can access computing services on demand, paying only for what they use.

## 1. What is an On-Premise Setup?

An **on-premise (on-prem)** setup refers to traditional IT infrastructure where all hardware, software, and networking components are **installed and managed within an organization’s own physical location** (such as a data center).

### Key Characteristics:

* Servers are hosted inside the organization
* Hardware procurement and maintenance are the organization’s responsibility
* Requires dedicated IT staff
* High upfront capital investment
* Limited scalability

**Example:**
A company buying physical servers, installing them in a server room, and managing power, cooling, security, and backups on its own.

## 2. What is Cloud?

The **cloud** refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet that are used to store, manage, and process data instead of local servers or personal computers.

These servers are owned and maintained by **cloud service providers** such as:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## 3. What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the on-demand delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet on a **pay-as-you-go** basis.

### Core Concept:

> “Access IT resources on demand without owning the infrastructure.”

### Key Features:

* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Rapid scalability
* Measured (pay-per-use) service

## 4. Difference Between Cloud Computing and Traditional On-Premise Setup

| Feature                  | On-Premise Setup            | Cloud Computing              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Infrastructure Ownership | Owned by the organization   | Owned by cloud provider      |
| Initial Cost             | Very high (CAPEX)           | Low or none                  |
| Payment Model            | Fixed cost                  | Pay-as-you-go                |
| Scalability              | Limited and slow            | Highly scalable              |
| Maintenance              | Managed by internal IT team | Managed by provider          |
| Deployment Speed         | Weeks or months             | Minutes                      |
| Accessibility            | Limited to local network    | Accessible over the internet |
| Disaster Recovery        | Expensive and complex       | Built-in and easier          |
| Updates & Patching       | Manual                      | Automatic                    |

## 5. Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Cost Efficiency**

   * No need to invest in expensive hardware
   * Pay only for the resources used

2. **Scalability and Flexibility**

   * Easily scale resources up or down based on demand

3. **High Availability**

   * Services are distributed across multiple data centers

4. **Faster Deployment**

   * Infrastructure can be provisioned in minutes

5. **Reduced Maintenance**

   * Cloud providers handle hardware, updates, and patching

6. **Global Accessibility**

   * Access applications and data from anywhere

7. **Disaster Recovery and Backup**

   * Built-in backup and recovery solutions

## 6. Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Internet Dependency**

   * Requires reliable internet connectivity

2. **Security and Privacy Concerns**

   * Data is stored with third-party providers

3. **Limited Control**

   * Less control over underlying infrastructure

4. **Vendor Lock-In**

   * Difficult to migrate between cloud providers

5. **Ongoing Operational Costs**

   * Improper resource management can increase costs

6. **Compliance Challenges**

   * Regulatory requirements may restrict cloud usage

---

## Summary

* **On-premise**: Full control but high cost and low scalability
* **Cloud computing**: Flexible, scalable, and cost-effective
* Cloud is ideal for modern applications, startups, and dynamic workloads
* On-premise may still be preferred for strict compliance or legacy systems
